# 128-Bit Arithmetic Operations in x390 Assembly

## Overview

This project implements 128-bit signed arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in IBM x390 assembly language. The program reads three input lines per operation: a 128-bit signed number, an operator, and another 128-bit number. It continues processing until it receives 'q' as input.

## Usage

The program accepts input in the following format:

[128-bit number 1]

[operator (+, -, *, /)]

[128-bit number 2]


Enter 'q' to quit the program.

##  Requirements

- IBM x390 assembly environment
- Standard C library for I/O operations
- Compatible simulator for execution

## Notes

This project was completed as a part of the Computer Structure and Language course.
